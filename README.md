# Obstacle-and-Sign-Detection-Self_driving-Car-Project

## Introduction

### Project Definition

Society has witnessed the technology increasingly develop at a fast pace, and a lot of money is spent on transportation vehicles which is one of the most important aspects of many requirements of people. Autonomous cars are developed by several companies like Tesla, Audi, and VinFast, and it is vital to minimize the arising of extremely hazardous accidents due to careless people driving. It means car driving potentially becomes much easier and safer for anyone than before.
There are some conditions to meet the standard of an autonomous car: <br>
- Capable of moving to an expected location without taking any control from human  <br>
- Able to synthesize data from numerous sources so as to perform both successful and safe autonomous driving route <br>
- Data from a range of sensors installed on the vehicle is processed by intelligent algorithms running on the car's industrial computer system. A camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonic sensor, and several types of navigation sensors are among the sensors available. The self-driving car can distinguish between lanes, objects, bumpers, turn signals, and traffic lights using data from its sensors. As a result, it may control the steering wheel, brakes, and system signal lights on the car. <br>
This project intends to design and produce a straightforward autonomous car that can analyze the surrounding race without any human involvement and make decisions accordingly without any human interactions. By being equipped with two or three sensors and a camera, the car can get live footage of the targeted route and utilize that to determine the accurate route. A number of sensors are combined and are used to identify the pathway and road signal from the surroundings.  <br>
